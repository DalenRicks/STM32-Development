# STM32-Development
These codes were developed for the Power Electronics Society STM32 Workshops. They consist of simple blink sketches to more complicated operations with the aim of improving the student population's knowledge and skill wish such a widely used microcontroller. All of the programs were developed for the NUCLEO F446RE development board. 


The projects created for the workshops will need to be imported into STM32CubeIDE to be used. Please review the steps for how to import a project before attempting to use one of the programs within this repository. Inside the ZIP files will be the working code to be imported into the IDE, as well as a text document highlighting the added code.

# Importing a Project
Download and unzip the project that you would like to work on. Once loaded into the IDE workspace, navigate to the "File" tab in the top left of the screen and select "Import". Under the "General" tab, select "Existing Projects into Workspace." Click "Browse" in the "Select Root Directory" window, find the unzipped file in your file directory and select it. Once selected, click the project that populates the window and hit "Finish."
