# STM32-Development
These codes were developed for the Power Electronics Society STM32 Workshops. They consist of simple blink sketches to more complicated operations with the aim of improving the student population's knowledge and skill wish such a widely used microcontroller.


The projects created for the workshops will need to be imported into STM32CubeIDE to be used. Please review the steps for how to import a project before attempting to use one of the programs within this repository.
